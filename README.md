Google Colaboratory guidelines

The Jupyter notebooks can be run on an IDE installed on your computer or via Google Colaboratory: https://colab.research.google.com/. In the latter case, no software or Python packages need to be installed on your machine, and you can run the entire exercise in your browser. Google Chrome is recommended as a browser, but any browser can be used. These guidelines help you set up and run the provided software in Google Colab.

To use Google Colab, alongside an internet browser, you will need: a Google account: https://www.google.com/account/about; min—500 MB of storage available in Google Drive for the files that will be generated and downloaded there.

You can import the notebooks required for the practicum via GitHub. After logging into your Google account, go to the ‘File’ menu and click ‘open notebook’ and select the ‘GitHub’ tab. Then copy the Geostatistics Practicum GitHub link in the URL bar.

The link is: https://github.com/SENSE-UGent/E_I002454_Geostatistics.git

You can then select the first notebook. After pressing the ‘open new notebook’ button (indicated in red on the screen print above), you will have imported the notebook into your Collaboratory project, which will open in a new tab. Next, save the notebook to your Google Drive [File > Save a copy in Drive]:

When you have taken these steps, you have a local copy of the notebook that you can run and edit.

Guidelines adapted from P. De Smedt for ESS course.

The notebooks mainly use the python package 'GeostatsPy':
Pyrcz, M.J., Jo. H., Kupenko, A., Liu, W., Gigliotti, A.E., Salomaki, T., and Santos, J., 2021, GeostatsPy Python Package: Open-source Spatial Data Analytics and Geostatistics, DOI: /doi/10.5281/zenodo.13835444.

The notebooks are mainly based on the demo notebooks from:
Pyrcz, Michael J. (2021). PythonNumericalDemos: Educational Data Science Python Demonstrations Repository (0.0.1). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5564966

The Jura dataset was taken from: Goovaerts P., 1997. Geostatistics for Natural Resources Evaluation. Oxford University Press.
