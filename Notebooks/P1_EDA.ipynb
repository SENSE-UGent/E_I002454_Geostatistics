    "The following notebook was compiled for the course 'Geostatistics' at Ghent University (lecturer-in-charge: Prof. Dr. Ellen Van De Vijver; teaching assistant: Pablo De Weerdt). It consists primarily of notebook snippets created by Michael Pyrcz. The code and markdown (text) snippets were edited specifically for this course, using the 'Jura data set' (Goovaerts, 1997) as example in the practical classes. Some new code snippets are also included to cover topics which were not found in the Geostastpy package demo books.<br> \n",

The part below the asterisk line is where the rest of the code that is required to perform the operation is written, but to complete the practiical exercise you are not required to change anything.\n",

    "#### Motivation for Bivariate Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many important reasons to learn bivariate analysis methods to strengthen your foundation in geostatistics,\n",
    "\n",
    "**Never a Single Feature** - most often we work with multiple features. It is quite rare to model a single feature as part of a geostatistical modeling workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "* petroleum rock and fluid system features - facies, porosity, permeability and fluid saturations\n",
    "\n",
    "* mining deposit features - concentration of copper, nickel, silver, gold and sulfur\n",
    "\n",
    "* agriculture soil features - pH level, soil moisture, nitrogen, phosphorus, clay content and organic matter\n",
    "\n",
    "* forestry inventory features - tree density, species composition, tree height, basal area and above-ground biomass\n",
    "\n",
    "Our spatial models are multivariate, so we cannot model a single feature in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geostatistics is Limited to Multivariate** - I do not like making this confession. While some will respond with a comment about some novel workflow that builds multivariate geostatistical models, for example [Step-wise Conditional Transform](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1023235505120) by Dr. Leuangthong and Professor Deutsch. \n",
    "\n",
    "* yet, the common practice is limited to 2 features at a time, primary feature being modeled supported by a secondary feature\n",
    "\n",
    "* this is based on variants of the cokriging system that we introduce in the [Cosimulation](GeostatsPy_cosimulation) chapter \n",
    "\n",
    "* a sequential approach is applied model more than 2 features, for example, simulate copper, cosimulate nickel with copper as secondary, cosimulate gold with nickel as secondary\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we must understand bivariate analysis methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bivariate Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand and quantify the relationship between two variables, i.e., the bivariate probability density function, $f_{x,y}(x,y)$, for example,\n",
    "\n",
    "* porosity and permeability\n",
    "\n",
    "* fraction of shale and oil recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "* copper and gold\n",
    "\n",
    "* basal area and tree height\n",
    "  \n",
    "How can we use these relationships? To improve our prediction models and ultimately make better decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What would be the impact if we ignore these relationships and simply modeled each feature separately?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **assumption of independence** - there will be no relationship between our estimates or simulated realizations, the joint probability density function will not be reproduced and unrealistic combinations may occur, e.g., very high permeability with very low porosity \n",
    "\n",
    "* **data conditioning** - will impose the relationship at data locations. The geostatistics models honor the data at the data locations and the data scatter plot is the correct relationship, but away from the data this relationship will fade\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bivariate statistics are our tools to quantify and impose these bivariate relationships in our geostatistical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bivariate Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pearson’s Product‐Moment Correlation Coefficient** or just the correlation coefficient or just correlation, is a widely-known bivariate statistic, if you say 0.9 correlation most engineers and scientists can visualize this! Here's the important points and limitations for the correlation coefficient,\n",
    "\n",
    "* the notation for correlation is, $\\rho_{x,y}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* provides a measure of the degree of linear relationship, i.e., nonlinear relationships will bias the correlation coefficient\n",

    "There are some other deeper points that should be made about the Gaussian assumption,\n",
    "\n",
    "* the correlation coefficient provides a complete description for the bivariate relationship only under the assumption of bivariate Gaussianity. If we assume Gaussian, then the means, $\\overline{x}$ and $\\overline{y}$, standard deviations, $s_x$ and $s_y$, with the correlation coefficient, $\\rho_{x,y}$ completely describe the bivariate probability density function $f_{x,y}(x,y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "* for any other distributions, the correlation coefficient is not sufficient to know the entire, bivariate probability density function $f_{x,y}(x,y)$, e.g., to calculate conditional distributions, $f_{x|y}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* the standard approach in geostatistics is to apply Gaussian anamorphosis to each feature and then to assume bivariate Gaussian so that the correlation coefficient is sufficient to describe the relationship between the two features\n",
    "\n",
    "What about spatial bivariate relationship?\n",
    "\n",
    "* the full cokriging system includes cross variograms and cross covariance that capture the relationships between two features over space! But due to the difficulty of inferring and modeling the required linear model of coregionalization, this is rarely done.\n",
    "\n",
    "* instead a simplifying apply like collocated cokriging is applied that only retains the collocated secondary data and limits the model of bivariate relationship to the collocated (lag $\\bf{h}$ of 0.0) correlation coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "More could be done! Let's review the sample variance of variable $x$. Of course, I'm truncating our notation as $x$ is a set of samples a locations in our modeling space, $x(\\bf{u_\\alpha}), \\, \\forall \\, \\alpha = 0, 1, \\dots, n - 1$.\n",
